## Use Foursquare Data to Enhance Property Valuation Models

### Introduction

Property valuation models are used to estimate the market value of a property based on its characteristics, sales history and market information. Such models are widely used in different fields. For example, municipal governments use the models to estimate the property tax base, banks and insurance companies use the models to determine the risks associated with mortgage loans, and individual home buyers and sellers or real estate agents use the models to decide on the price they set or offer on a property.

One of the most popular types of property valuation models is the hedonic model, which estimates the market value of a property based on the characteristics of the home and its environment. Typically, the models are specified as a regression model, where the dependent variable is the market value of the home, while the independent variables normally include age, floor area size, lot size, dwelling type (such as single-detached, semi-detached, or apartment), number of floors, bedrooms and bathrooms, etc.

The value of a home is influenced not only by its internal characteristics, but also by characteristics of the neighbourhood it is in. Neighbourhood amenities, such as parks, schools, shopping and dinning, often have a direct impact on house prices. While internal characteristics are often easier to measure and collect, data on the external amenities are much difficult to gather. The lacking of such data often leads to less-than-optimal property valuation models.
